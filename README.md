# BSC-coin-statistics

Simple script that take information about coin from clients.json file and produce separated json files with holders amount, change of holders amount in last 24h, number of transactions, value of marketing wallet, distributed rewards, circulating supply (total supply - burned token) and real market cap calculated from circulating supply. Used 3 different api providers (bscscan, covalent, bitquery) so to run it you need to create accounts on that sites and add API keys to .env file. If some data not provided to clients.json (i.e. token don't pay rewards) it just enter 0 to resposible for field.
